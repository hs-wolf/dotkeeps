# DotKeeps

DotKeeps is an app that helps you save and manage where you stopped at a certain media, like series seasons, comics volumes, or manga chapters. No more hundreds of open tabs, everything is in one place.

The project is free and open source, no data is sold to any third parties.

The app will go through updates now and then, feel free to make contributions.

If by any chance the project comes to and end, registered users will be able to download their data.
